        How I succeeded turning a PHP\/MYSQL app into Android app within a week --
        \n\nAlright. So I wanted to grab your attention to what I''m about to write.
        If you are here just to read about the technologies I used, jump to bottom.
        \n\nThis is also a kind of rant; rant against the other fellow devs who demotivated
        me originally when I asked a question. \n\nI''ll not go in the details of
        my original question. Here''s the link for those who are interested: \nhttps:\/\/www.devrant.io\/rants\/366496\nIt''s
        been days since I achieved what I wanted to but I thought someone might learn
        from my experience. So here it goes. \n\nWhy FREE? \nWell, it was an important
        client. I worked on his website and he asked for an app for the same website
        and told me he won''t be able to pay me anything for the app. I was, somewhat,
        under the impression that he might be testing me. If not, then I would end
        up learning something new. It wasn''t a bad deal for me so I didn''t hesitate
        to took it. \n\nWithin a week, I was able to pull the job and finish it. I
        felt so much better (and proud of myself) when I finished the app within the
        week and client approved it. What did I get? I got a GOOD BANK CLIENT in my
        pocket now. Got a lot more worth of projects from the same client. If I were
        being paid for the app, I might not have pulled the job so much better. \n\nSo
        the moral of this story is never to give up. NOT EVERY DEVELOPER SELLS SHORT
        ONLY FOR \"MONEY\". Some enjoy learning new things. And some like me love
        to accept new challenges and are not afraid to try something new everyday.
        \n\nIn case, someone is interested in knowing the technologies I used, here
        they go; \n\nPhoneGap \nFramework7 \nTemplate7 \nApache Cordova \n\nI wrote
        an API for the interaction between the web services and the app. \n\nAlso,
        Ionic Framework seems promising but it had a learning curve and time was of
        the essence. But I''m gonna learn it anyhow.","num_upvotes":32,"num_downvotes":0,"score":32,"created_time":1485606561,"attached_image":"","num_comments":13,"tags":["rant","hybrid

        sure if this qualifies for a rant or not, but it''s free entertainment. \nI
        promise it''s good.\nGet your snacks and buckle up. My cat said it''s a solid
        5\/7, so that''s something.\n\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf55\u2615\nSo, someone from
        my team (one of the higher ups, let''s call him Mr.Z) got fired yesterday
        because he said the wrong thing to the wrong person (Let''s call him Mr A)
        3 months ago.\nApparently, he went over his boss''s head (let''s call him
        B) and asked for a promotion and said that ''B'' isn''t fit for his position
        and that he should have that job.\nWhat he didn''t count on was the fact that
        A and B are kinda tight (I think the fact that they are both from the same
        ivy league school also plays into this. I''m not gonna say which school, but
        it''s one out of Harvard and Stanford) So, A got B''s back and he told B that
        one of his minions is getting out of line... and he should clean his house....
        and clean his house he did. Plotted and planned for 3 months and executed
        yesterday.\nZ was kind of a douche but I feel really sorry for him though.
        He just bought a $1,000,000 house recently and now he''s out of work. Poor
        guy.\nI hope he finds something soon.\nHe tried to steal some of my work too.
        Lol.\n(I did write about this in one of my earlier rants I think. About people
        taking credit behind closed doors)\nAnd this was also used as one of the reasons
        to fire him among other things.\nI knew that he would try to steal it but
        I didn''t say anything because I didn''t care. \nHell, I even sat him down
        and explained it to him line for line when he asked me how it worked. I knew
        it right then that he''s gonna explain it to the board of his superiors like
        it was his own code. But I still made sure I explained it to him really well,
        so that he could replicate the explanation if needed.\nI was playing it strategically.
        The way I saw it was, that piece of code didn''t really matter to me much,
        because it couldn''t be used to file a patent or something but if he can show
        it off as his own, he would make some of his superiors happy.\nThey''re happy
        == he''s happy.\nAnd that makes my life a little easier because now he''d
        be willing to help me out with something in the future or maybe overlook some
        minor stuff if I ever make a mistake in my work...\nIt''s always good to have
        something in your back pocket for a rainy day.\nIt''s life...you never know
        when you''re gonna need a favor.\nAll I gotta say is, Fucking office politics
        is crazy.\nDon''t gamble a hand when you don''t know what your opponent is
        holding.\nZ gambled and lost. Could have gone the other way, but the chances
        were very slim.","num_upvotes":7,"num_downvotes":1,"score":7,"created_time":1485631956,"attached_image":"","num_comments":4,"tags":["don''t
