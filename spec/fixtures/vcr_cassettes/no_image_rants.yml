        man who runs my IT department. The man who is in charge of all things and
        people that are technical: IT management  software development, infrastructure,
        training, help desk, system administration\u200b, etc. A man with a staff
        of fifty plus. If you were to peel back the flesh on this man''s head and
        crack open his skull you would find dung beetles feasting on the feces that
        power his thoughts and motor functions. Underneath this foul membrane, if
        you could push past the maggots; the meal worms; his undying love for hourly
        binges of Johnny Walker Black on any day of the week with a name that contains
        a vowel; his fascination with shiny objects and his endless internal monologue
        wondering when they would hatch rainbow ponies that fly; his desire whenever
        he enters a paint store to open all the cans of paint and taste the different
        colors; if you could push past all of the vile crap that exists where Thomas
        Aquinas once theorized there was a soul, you would find a colony of paramecia
        at the end of their short lives laughing hysterically at how much smarter
        they were than the host they lived in.\n\nThis man was in charge of hiring
        the Manager of Software Development. The manager I report to. After seven
        months of ignoring this chore; after interviewing the sum total of four candidates;
        after making a point to tell myself and a colleague that there was no one
        qualified to fill this position within our company (an opinion that is both
        untrue and, when spoken, runs afoul of internal hiring policies) this man
        hired a soulless cretin with no experience in software development or with
        running a software development group. A man who regularly confuses web servers
        and SQL servers. A man who asked me how my previous manager reviewed my work,
        was told by me that said previous manager read my code, and then replied in
        his capacity as the manager of software development that \"looking at code
        is a compete waste of time for a manager.\" A man so without any humanity
        or reason for being that he will sit silently, creepily, in conference rooms
        with the lights off waiting for meetings to begin. Meetings he has scheduled.
        That have no reason for being in the first place. Just like himself.\n\nShortly
        before the man in charge offered the Dev Manager job to the simulacrum of
        human flesh that is my manager, he met with me and others who had been involved
        in the interview process. When I informed him that hiring someone with no
        technical knowledge for a very technical position would be a mistake that
        he would suffer through for years, he replied in reference to his future hire
        that \"his managerial experience makes up for his lack of technical knowledge.\"\n\nBest.
        Prank. Ever. Worst prank ever too.
